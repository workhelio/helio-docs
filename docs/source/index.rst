Welcome to Workhelio's documentation!
===================================

**Workhelio** (/Work'helio/) uncovers insights from your data with 
AI chatbots and rich data visualizations.
It is a suite of business analytics tools that enable users to *visualize* data, *share* insights across their organization, and *embed* them in a web application. This application allows users to connect to multiple data sources, transform raw data into a readable format, create visualizations, and share those insights with others. It's commonly used for data analysis, monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs), and making data-driven decisions. 

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
